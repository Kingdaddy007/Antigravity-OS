## STATUS VERIFICATION GATE

Treat platform availability, model limits, filter behavior, enforcement actions, and API status dated February-March 2026 as historical snapshots. Before relying on them, verify current official ByteDance/Seedance documentation. If verification is unavailable, label the claim unverified and avoid presenting it as current fact.

Navigate the Seedance 2.0 content filter and write prompts that pass.

## The Problem: The 37% Block Rate

Practitioner data (Feb 2026) shows that **37% of all Seedance 2.0 prompts are blocked**. The vast majority are not actual policy violations but rather **filter misjudgments** of creative intent. This skill explains how the filter thinks and how to write prompts that it understands.

## How the Filter Thinks

The content filter is not a simple keyword blocker. It is a **language model** that evaluates the entire prompt as a single, coherent scene. It assesses **intent and context**, not just individual words.

| Filter Behavior | Implication for Prompt Writing |
|---|---|
| Evaluates whole prompt as one scene | A violent word in a professional, cinematic context may pass where a casual one fails. |
| Reads intent, not keywords | "Film production" framing gets more latitude than casual descriptions. |
| Production language signals professionalism | Shot types, lens specs, lighting terms → higher pass rate. |
| Casual language signals risk | Prompts that read like "notes to a friend" get flagged more often. |

**The core principle:** Write like a filmmaker, not a casual user.

---

## The Four-Question Framework

To signal professional intent, every prompt should answer these four questions:

1.  **Where is the scene?** (e.g., `abandoned warehouse`, `neon-lit alley`, `foggy mountaintop`)
2.  **What does it look like?** (e.g., `rusting machinery`, `wet pavement with reflections`, `ancient pine trees`)
3.  **What is the camera doing?** (e.g., `slow dolly push-in`, `handheld tracking shot`, `static wide shot`)
4.  **What is the atmosphere?** (e.g., `tense and quiet`, `energetic and chaotic`, `serene and cold`)

A prompt that answers these four questions is far less likely to be misinterpreted by the filter.

## High-Risk Word Categories

Certain words trigger heightened scrutiny across the entire prompt, even if the intent is innocent. Avoid them where possible.

| Category | High-Risk Words | Safer Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| **Age (Youth)** | `child`, `kid`, `young`, `boy`, `girl` | Describe by role (`apprentice`, `student`), action (`learning to...`), or relative age (`the younger of the two`). |
| **Violence (Direct)** | `kill`, `shoot`, `stab`, `blood` | Use cinematic euphemisms: `neutralizes target`, `discharges weapon`, `a brief struggle`, `red liquid`. |
| **Intimacy** | `intimate`, `sensual`, `passionate` | Describe the physical action: `a gentle touch on the arm`, `a shared glance`, `standing close together`. |

## Practical Techniques for Passing the Filter

### 1. Image Upload Best Practices

-   **Avoid Competing Information:** If you upload a character image with `@Image1`, **do not** describe their appearance in the text prompt. This creates conflicting information that confuses the filter.
-   **Use Face-Away Poses:** To avoid triggering facial recognition filters, use images where the character is facing away from the camera, is in silhouette, or is seen from a distance.
-   **Prefer Illustration:** Illustrated or stylized character art is less likely to trigger real-person likeness filters than photorealistic images.

### 2. The Chinese Prompt Trick

-   **Community-Discovered:** Some users report higher pass rates by writing the main scene description in **Chinese** while keeping dialogue or specific technical terms in English.
-   **Why it works:** The model was trained on a massive corpus of Chinese-language data, and its Chinese-language filters have different thresholds and nuances.
-   **Example:**
    ```
    (prompt in Chinese describing a complex action scene)
    Character A says: "We have to go, now."
    ```

### 3. Lead with Professionalism

-   **Front-load cinematic language.** Start your prompt with camera movements, lens types, or lighting descriptions. This immediately signals to the filter that you are creating a film, not describing a real-world event.
-   **Example:**
    ```
    (Good) ✅ "Low-angle tracking shot. A figure in a long coat runs down a wet alley..."
    (Bad)  ❌ "A person is running down an alley. It's dark and wet..."
    ```

## Diagnosing a Blocked Prompt

If your prompt is blocked, follow this checklist:

1.  **Check for High-Risk Words:** Is there a word from the table above that could be rephrased?
2.  **Check for IP/Likeness:** Does it violate the rules in `seedance-copyright`?
3.  **Check for Ambiguity:** Is your intent clear? Could a machine misinterpret your creative description as a real-world policy violation?
4.  **Rewrite with the Four-Question Framework:** Ensure you have clearly described the Where, What, Camera, and Atmosphere.
5.  **Try the Chinese Prompt Trick:** As a last resort, translate the descriptive parts of your prompt to Chinese.

## REFERENCE LOADING RULES

Load `references/extended-guidance.md` when the task needs detailed implementation rules, examples, edge cases, diagnostics, or verification beyond the core workflow above. Inspect its Contents first and load only the matching sections.

## OUTPUT SHAPE

Deliver the requested artifact or decision, the key rationale and tradeoffs, and a concise verification checklist.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE CHECKLIST

1. Apply the core workflow above.
2. Load matching extended guidance for substantive or high-risk work.
3. Preserve user constraints and verify the result before delivery.
